## Description

This Prework was guide to get us started for first day of bootcamp, using easy and informative manuals to work on different code independtly. My motivation is the excitment that code provides and i built this project becuase I am enthusiatic for the first day and know I need to be well prepared for that. I faced and solved a range of problems, from SSH key errors to DevTools console debugging etc. I learnt that code is a straight forward as long as you havent made a spelling mistake, the majority of concepts are easy to get used to.
